the

there

still
a
load

I
figure
that

Supporters
of
the

are
concerned
an
airline
might
sacrifice
costly
safety
measures
in
order
to
repay
debt
.

Indeed
,
some
investment
bankers
have
already
started
restructuring
deals
to
cope
with
the
expected
rules
.

Last
week
the
stock
hit
an
all-time
high
of
37

getting
roughed
up
in

Valley
National

slide
of

followed
its
report
late
Wednesday
of
a
$
72.2

third-quarter
loss
.

Since
then
,
Della

won
Pan

as
an
international
client
and
also
does
work
for
a
few
packaged-goods
clients
,
including
Dow
Chemical
Co.

,
Fannie

issued
$
400

Remic

in

through
First

As
an
alternative
,
taxpayers
could
chose
to
reduce
their
gains
by
an
inflation
index
.

The

She
urges
client

to
begin
a
``
detoxification
''
period
,
purging
social
and
other
nonproductive
activities
and
setting
time
apart
for
themselves
.

Also
,
it
has
not
yet
been
decided
exactly
how
much
of
the
mortgage

will
be
able
to
convert
into
equity

He
said
that
his

was
a

,
but
that
he
was
n't
actually
asked

resign
.

Among
other
things
,
the
Agriculture
Department
is
widely
thought
to
be
mulling
whether
to
subsidize
the
sale
of
soybean
oil
to
the
Soviet
Union
.

He
figured
wrong
.

An
earnings
disappointment
may
reflect
a
situation
that
's
short-term
.

Sen.
Lloyd
Bentsen
-LRB-
D.
,
Texas
-RRB-
was
outraged
after
a
private
word
to
John
Motley
,
lobbyist
for
the
National
Federation
of
Independent
Business
,
resulted
in
a
news
release
saying
that
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
chairman
would
recommend
repeal
of
Section
89
.

In
a
filing
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
Sony
also
said
two
more
suits
have
been
filed
opposing
the
company
's
agreement
to
buy
Columbia
.

``

And
when

component
of

,

or

--
loses
liquidity
,
the
price
discovery
system

are
determined

becomes
flawed
or
is
lost
entirely
for
a

Mr.

,
47
years
old
,
said
in
a
telephone
interview
that
he
has
been
considering
and
discussing
a
number
of
possible
business
ventures
,
but
that
``
nothing
is
at
a
mature
stage
.
''

The
charge
did
n't
affect
net
for
the
quarter
as
it
was
offset
by
tax
benefits
.

Messrs.
Fleischmann
and
Pons
initially
reported
indirect
evidence
of
neutrons
being
produced
in
their
experiment
but
later
conceded
the
measurements
were
questionable
.

Federal
Reserve
officials
sent
another
signal
of
their
determination
to
shore
up
investor
confidence
.

Newly
acquired
assets
would
get
a
bigger
break
than
those
currently
held
.

``

,

,
are
being
boosted
by
large
increases
in

in

This
news
raised
hopes
for

Says

Another

of

Company

said
later
that
British

believes
its

ended
last
Friday
when
the

group
,
which
also
includes

failed
to
obtain
financing
for
the

transaction
.

One

noted
in
astonishment
that

seemed
to
mind
the
news
that
British

is

making
a
special

That

mostly
in
reaction
to
last

plunge
,
which
prompted
concern
that
it
might
signal
a
similar
sharp
slowing
of

and
thus
reduced
demand
for

Of

Analysts
said
the

were
better

partly
because
of
strong

a
positive
foreign-currency
translation

But
these
players
were
dead

The

,
in
which
11
GOP

Nevertheless

In
theory
,
the
value
attached
to
a

by
the

the
cost
of
replacing

should
be
the
same
.

Mr.
Gras
said
the
joint

represents
considerable
savings

Some
people
argue

Many
industry
analysts
had
been
projecting
a
3

The

one

there
will
still
be

Although

been
guarded

Mr.

Yesterday

of
$
101.75
,
down
50

on

puts

which
is
as
low
as
it
has
sunk
over

That
's
why
some
investment
managers
,
such
as
Alex
Powers
,
a
vice
president
of
Chase
Manhattan

's
private

,
do

If

to
play
there
by

,
says

Now
he
has
settled

that
fits

bill
--

Today
a
President
can
still
send
up
spending
rescissions

but
they
're
meaningless
unless
Congress
has
a
guilty
conscience

changes
its

issued
a

Mr.

the

But
therein
lies
another
aspect
of
investment
risk
:
the
hazard
of
shaping
your

to
avoid
one

more
types

risk
and
being
blind-sided
by

And

,
told
the
committee
in
a
private
meeting
yesterday
that
Eastern
's
latest
plan
to
emerge
from
bankruptcy-law
protection
is
far
riskier
than
an
earlier
one
which
won
the
creditors
'
approval
.

First
City
said
that
because
of
increased
competition
in
the
credit-card
business
,
it
had
decided
it
either
had
to
expand
its
own
holdings
substantially
or
sell
them
.

``
With
the

you
could
only

to
cut
exposure
to
the

says
a
money
manager
.

The
federal
response
to
California
's
earthquake
crisis
was
marred
by
coast-to-coast
name-calling
between
the
White
House
and
San
Francisco
's
Mayor
Art
Agnos
.

Valley
National
said
it
made
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
an
``
overall
assessment
of
the
marketplace
''
and
the
condition
of
its
loan
portfolio
and
after
reviewing
it
with
federal
regulators
.

Mr.

Why
not
watch
or
hear
your
experience
historicized
while
you
were
living
it
?

Mr.
Courter
,
by
comparison
,
seems
a
shadow
of
the
confident

who
defended
Oliver
North
before
national

at
Iran-Contra
hearings
two
years
ago
.

Meanwhile

If

here

need

It
's
estimated
that
one
in
six
couples
experiences
infertility
,
and
in
1987
,
Americans
spent
about
$
1
billion
to
fight
the
problem

At
a
back-yard
barbecue
,
for
example
,
a
friend
boasts
that
she
'll
only
have
to
pay

on
her
John
Hancock
policy
for
seven
years
and
that
her
death
benefits
will
then
be
``
guaranteed

a

of

The
government
attributed
the

month-to-month

in

largely
to
higher

Not

Earthquake
's
Damage

The
larger
parallel
after
the
earthquake
centered
south
of
San
Francisco
is
surely
with
the
state
of
the
U.S.
economy
.

Rick
Sherlund
,
a
Goldman
Sachs
analyst
,
said
Lotus
had
upgrade
revenue
of
about
$
22
million
in
the
quarter
,
twice
what
he
had
expected
.

Meanwhile
,
the

International
Business
Machines
Corp.
will
announce
on
Tuesday
a
slew
of
software
products
aimed
at
eliminating
some
of
the
major
problems
involved
in
computerizing
manufacturing
operations
,
industry
executives
said
.

By
afternoon
,
the
broader
market
joined
the
advance
in
full
strength
.

However
,
when
powerful
forces
start
shaking
the
market
's
structure
,
the
more
``
earthquake-resistant
''
it
is
,
the
better
its
chance
for
survival
.

After
prodding
from
Mr.
Sanford
,
U.S.
Attorney
Jack
Eskenazi
pleaded
with
Justice
Department
officials
in
Washington
to
let
the
indictment
proceed
.

The
post
of
chief
executive
has
been
vacant
since
July
when
Terry
Pryce
,
55
,
left
the
company
.

``
It
's
part
of
our
style
,
too
.
''

That
helped
persuade
the
company
to
introduce
a
new
advertising
slogan
:
``
A
warm
hug
from
Campbell
's
.
''

That
means
that
a
corporation
,
after
a
specified
amount
of
time
has
passed
,
can
buy
back
its
bonds
by
paying
investors
the
face
value
-LRB-
plus
,
in
some
cases
,
a
sweetener
-RRB-
.

The
circuit
breakers
caused
a
30-minute
shutdown
in

as
the

were
falling

As
vice
president\/national-government
relations
,
Mr.
Womack
will
work
with
P&G
's
top
management
and
with
the
company
's
government-relations
staff
``
to
represent
P&G
's
interests
at
the
federal
level
,
''
said
John
G.
Smale
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

But
some
money
managers
are
doing
just
that
.

Western
New
Mexico
Telephone
,
Silver
City
,
had
net
income
of
$
1.9
million
on
revenue
of
about
$
10
million
last
year
.

Mr.
Mastro
has
been
with
the
New
York
U.S.
attorney
's
office
for
nearly
five
years
.

Trading
also
was
heavy
in
the
over-the-counter
market
.

Some
analysts
suggest
,
however
,
that
the
ratio
has
weakened
in
value
as
an
indicator
because
options
and
other
products
can
be
used
to
hedge
short
positions
.

But
now
,
an
official
says
,
he
is
``
surrounded
by
right-to-lifers
,
''
who
contend
that
any
breakthroughs
in
fetal-tissue
research
could
increase
the
demand
for
abortions
.

Merck

Many

firms
had
similarly
bullish
views

to

at
the

The

more

,
allows
the
results
to
be
interpreted
with
a
high
degree
of
confidence
.

The

after

Armenian
earthquake
a

,
quite
literally
,
a
city
whose

The

A

Mr.

gap
,
warns
that
even
if
the
trade
figures
are
bullish
for

,
the

wo
n't

much
because

will
want

It

also
lead

.

Key
to
the
issue
is
that
the

,
in
skillful

,
can
go
virtually
anywhere

in

can
become

If

I

that

be
able

because

It

Amoco

The
process
typically
begins
when
an

a

credit-card

them

Says

If

The

helps
carriers
solve
pricing
problems

such
as
how

react
to
discounts
offered
by
competitors
or
what
would
be
the
optimum
number
of
seats
to
offer
at
a
given
price
.

He
said
the
improvement
was
a
result
of
cost
savings
achieved
by
consolidating
manufacturing
operations
,
blending
two
sales
organizations
and
focusing
more
carefully
the

``

we
have
ways
of
holding
wealth
similar

Barring
any
