Here

Japanese
banks
accounted
for
50
%
of
the
NWA
bank
debt
,
according
to
a
report
by
Transportation
Secretary
Samuel
Skinner
.

As
previously
reported
,
those
sales
have
been
declining
this
year
in
the
wake
of
allegations
that
the
company
engaged
in
unfair
sales
practices
that
encouraged
customers
to
overpurchase
services
.

The

medium-term

long-term

countries
total
$
293
million
,
of
which
$
146
million
are
n't
accruing
interest
,
the
bank
said
.

The
bank
has
a
negative
net
worth
,
they
say
.

Brokers
agreed
with
the
two-tier
price
theory
.

If
no
margin
agreed
,
there
is
a
fallback
rate

plus

Scott

a

points
out

for

,
``
the
value
of

n't
change
all

The

bemused

In
the
wake
of
the
earthquake
in
California
and
the
devastation
of
Hurricane
Hugo
,
many
companies
in
disaster-prone
areas
are
pondering
the
question
of
preparedness

At
the
opening

way

Until

,
the

spends

wasted

half

At
Citicorp
,
the
Problem
Review
Board
may
hear
only
12
or
so
cases
because
of
personnel
's
skill
in
complaint-resolution
.

In
consenting
to
the
injunctions
,
none
of
the
individuals
or
companies
admitted
or
denied
the
allegations
.

Though
it
's
probably
safe
to
assume
that
the
majority
of
financial
planners
are
honest
and
even
reasonably
competent
,
the
fact
remains
that
,
as
one
wag
puts
it
,
``
anybody
who
can
fog
a
mirror
''
can
call
himself
a
financial
planner
.

Prompted
by
an
earlier
California
earthquake
,
as
well
as
a
fire
in
a
Los
Angeles
office
tower
,
Great
Western
Bank
in
the
past
year
hired
three
emergency
planners
and
spent
$
75,000
equipping
a
trailer
with
communications
gear
to
serve
as
an
emergency
headquarters
.

But
despite
the
flurry
of
interest
in
those
shares
,
dealers
said
,
the
market
remains
nervous
about
Wall
Street
's
volatility
and
high
U.K.
interest
rates
.

If
they
put
a
Republican
into
office
,
not
only
will
they
acquire
less
in
terms
of
local
benefits
but
their
selected
legislator
will
be
relatively
powerless
to
prevent
other
legislators
from
``
bringing
home
the
bacon
''
to
their
respective
constituencies
.

Nausea

James
L.
Madson

Mr.

But
lawyers
said
Mr.

probably
faced
much
more
potential
liability
because
,
when
he
sued

during
his
takeover
battle
,
he
filed
on
behalf
of
all
shareholders
.

So
the
men
who
ran
the
grain
pits
listened
when
Joseph
Sullivan
,
a
35-year-old
former
Wall
Street
Journal
newsman
,
offered
them
the
idea
of

higher

for
the

amount
;
I
'd
be
paying
so
heavily
just
to
have
the
option

getting
my

back
that
I

almost
have

To
the
extent
that
Democratic
legislators
from
the
South
have
held
a
disproportionate
share
of
power
in

since
1932
and
have
been
able
to
translate
such
clout
into
relatively
more
local
benefits
for
their
respective
constituencies
,
voters
in
the
South
have
had
an
especially
strong
incentive
to
keep
such
Democrats
in
office
.

Always

says
polls
this
summer
showed
that
the
single-issue
voters
had
about
evened
out
.

But
he
has
opposed
Medicaid
funding
of
abortions
for
poor
women
who
say
they
are
victims
of
rape
and
incest
,
arguing
that
those
exceptions
are
enforced
so
loosely
that
they
open
the
way
for
abortions
for
other
women
.

Among
the
biggest
winners
were
brokerage-house
stocks
,
responding
to
heavy
trading
volume
.

Forget
about
Treasury
bills
or
a
money-market
fund
.

Although
a
GOP
president
may
limit
local
benefits
to
the
voter
's
particular
district\/state
,
such
a
president
is
also
likely
to
be
more
effective
at
preventing
other
districts\/states
and
their
legislators
from
bringing
home
the
local
benefits
.

He
hurt
himself
further
this
summer
by
bringing
homosexual
issues
into
the
debate
;
and
by
wavering
on
this
issue
and
abortion
,
he
has
weakened
his
credibility
in
what
is
already
a
mean-spirited
campaign
on
both
sides
.

This
week
,
many
carriers
are
announcing
cut-rate
fares
designed
to
get
people
to
fly
on
some
of
the
most
hallowed
--
and
slowest
--
days
of
the
year
,
including
Christmas
.

``
There
is
talk
of
some
revamping
and
we
're
certainly
heading
in
the
direction
of
less
and
less
animation
,
''
said
Joseph
S.
Cicero
,
vice
president
of
finance
and
administration
for
National
Broadcasting
Co.
,
a
unit
of
General
Electric
Co
.

In
July
a
year
later
,
Warner
agreed
to
release
the
producers
from
their
old
contract
when
Messrs.
Guber
,
Peters
and
Sugarman
made
a
$
100
million
offer
to
buy
25
%
of
MGM\/UA
.

The
$
125-billion-a-year
Bay
area
economy
represents
one-fourth
of
the
economy
of
the
nation
's
most
populous
state
and
accounts
for
2
%
to
3
%
of
the
nation
's
total
output
of
goods
and
services
,
according
to
the
Center
for
Continuing
Study
of
the
California
Economy
in
Palo
Alto
.

Confidence
in
the
pound
is
widely
expected
to
take
another
sharp
dive
if
trade
figures
for
September
,
due
for
release
tomorrow
,
fail
to
show
a
substantial
improvement
from
July
and
August
's
near-record
deficits
.

In
one
ingenious
recent
example
of
a
Newport
Beach
boiler
room
,
prospective
investors
in
Capital
Trust
Inc.
were
allegedly
told
that
their
investment
in
precious
metals
was
insured
against
losses
``
caused
by
employees
due
to
dishonesty
,
destruction
or
disappearance
,
''
according
to
an
indictment
handed
up
by
a
federal
grand
jury
in
Los
Angeles
last
month
.

That
could
widen
the
yield
spread
between
Treasurys
and
asset-backed
securities
,
as
well
as
make
it
tougher
to
unload
the
latter
.

But
Pemex
managers
are
the
ones
most
thrilled
by
the
contract
.

But
with
industrial
growth
stagnant
and
inflation
showing
signs
of
easing
,
some
voices
may
call
for
measures
to
pump
new
life
into
the
economy
.

Mr.
Mason
says
he
's
convinced
the
public
still
wants
to
invest
in
common
stocks
,
even
though
they
believe
the
deck
is
stacked
against
them
.

So
far
Galileo
has
been
delayed
twice
,
once
because
of
a
computer
malfunction
connected
with
a
space-shuttle
engine
,
and
yesterday
because
of
the
weather
.

The
economy
's
slowdown
is
due
only
partly
to
the
austerity
program
launched
in
September
1988
to
cool
an
overheated
economy
and
tame
inflation
.

The
GOP
doubters
were
in
Congress
