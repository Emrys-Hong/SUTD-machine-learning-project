# SUTD ISTD 01.112 machine learning group project

This project is SUTD Machine Learning class project under the instruction of Prof. Lu Wei.

Part 1.

- Label dataset for sentiment analysis.

Part 2.

- Build a Navie version of Hidden Markov Model.

Part 3.

- Build a Hidden Markov Model and decoding using Viterbi algorithm.

Part 4.

- Build a Hidden Markov Model and decoding the 7th best path for prediction.

Part 5. Design Project.

- Build a Model for sequence tagging task, particularly on English Text Chunking task `dataset/EN` and Chinese Address Parsing Task `dataset/AL`.

For more detail, you can refer to  `Project.pdf`.

## Repository Structure

Result and report is in `main.ipynb`

Output files are under the `dataset/`

To replicate results, you need to install `scipy` and `numpy`, and replicate results in `CRF_AL.ipynb` and  `CRF_EN.ipynb`
